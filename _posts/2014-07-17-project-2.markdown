description: The LHC collides bunches of protons every 50 nanoseconds within each of its four experiments, each crossing producing a random number of proton-proton collisions (with a Poisson expectation between 10 and 35, depending on the LHC parameters) called events. Two colliding protons produce a small firework in which part of the kinetic energy of the protons is converted into new particles. Most of the resulting particles are very unstable and decay quickly into a cascade of lighter particles.

In this, an attempt is made to classify whether the given event was a signal or a background noise in the process of decay for Higgs particle acceleration.

The target feature is Label which is a binary variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features.

The metric used for evaluation is Precision.
